# Co-operative College - Feedback Tool

This tool was co-designed with coaches and students to provide an easy way for students to submit feedback after sessions, and for the Co-operative College to use this feedback to improve projects.

It allows coaches from Co-operative College to generate unique links for each cohort, for:

- Students, to leave feedback at the start and end of the project
- Students, to leave feedback at the end of each session for the duration of the project
- Coaches, to view all feedback submitted, and compare submissions from the start/end of the project

# Deployment

## Dependencies

The feedback tool is built as a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) web application, with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend. It should be served using a suitable webserver (e.g Apache/nginx) with PHP7.3 or higher installed.

Web application dependencies can be installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```
yarn;
composer install;
```

## Configuration

Create a copy of the sample environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env;
```

Set suitable values in `.env` for the following environment variables:

- `APP_KEY`: should be generated by running `php artisan key:generate`
- `APP_DEBUG`: should be `false` in non-local environments
- `APP_URL`: should be set to the URL where the application will be hosted

## Database

The application requires a MySQL-compatible database which is available to from the server. A new database and user should be created (the user requires permissions to create/drop tables).

`.env` database configuration should be updated:

- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT`
- `DB_DATABASE`
- `DB_USERNAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD`

To create all the database tables, and import the rating question data, run:

```
php artisan migrate;
php artisan data:import;
```

If you would like to seed the environment with test data, you can run:

```
php artisan db:seed;
```

## Front-end

To build the ReactJS application bundle (which is served by Laravel), run:

```
yarn prod;
```

# Local environment (sail)

Sail is a docker-based development environment for laravel. This repository contains a `docker-composer.yml` file which defines the docker configuration.

To set up Sail, install Docker and then from the project root, run:

```
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/opt \
    -w /opt \
    laravelsail/php80-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

Configure a bash alias:

```
alias sail="bash ./vendor/bin/sail"
```

You can then start the project by running:

```
sail up
```

## Configuration

Create a copy of the sample environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env;
```

Set suitable values in `.env` for the following environment variables:

- `APP_ENV`: should be set to `local`
- `APP_KEY`: should be generated by running `sail php artisan key:generate`
- `APP_DEBUG`: should be `true` local environments
- `APP_URL`: should be set to a domain configured in /etc/hosts e.g. `https://coop.test`

## Dependencies

The feedback tool is built as a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) web application, with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.

To install dependencies run:

```
yarn;
sail composer install;
```

# Database

For local development environments using Laravel Sail, make sure the following database configuration is set in .env:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=coop_feedback
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

To create all the database tables, and import the rating question data, run:

```
sail php artisan migrate;
sail php artisan data:import;
```

If you would like to seed the environment with test data, you can run:

```
sail php artisan db:seed;
```

## Front-end

To build the ReactJS application bundle (which is served by Laravel), run:

```
yarn watch
```

or:

```
yarn dev
```
