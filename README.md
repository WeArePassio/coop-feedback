# Co-operative College - Feedback Tool

This repository contains the feedback tool developed by Passio for Co-operative College.

It allows coaches from Co-operative college to generate unique links for each cohort, for:

- Students, to leave feedback at the start and end of the project
- Students, to leave feedback at the end of each session for the duration of the project
- Coaches, to view all feedback submitted, and compare submissions from the start/end of the project

# Deployment

## Dependencies

The feedback tool is built as a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) web application, with a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend. It should be served using a suitable webserver (e.g Apache/nginx) with PHP7.3 or higher installed.

Web application dependencies can be installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```
yarn;
composer install;
```

## Configuration

Create a copy of the sample environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env;
```

Set suitable values in `.env` for the following environment variables:

- `APP_KEY`: should be generated by running `php artisan key:generate`
- `APP_DEBUG`: should be `false` in non-local environments
- `APP_URL`: should be set to the URL where the application will be hosted

## Database

The application requires a MySQL-compatible database which is available to from the server. A new database and user should be created (the user requires permissions to create/drop tables).

`.env` database configuration should be updated:

- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT`
- `DB_DATABASE`
- `DB_USERNAME`
- `DB_PASSWORD`

To create all the database tables, and import the rating question data, run:

```
php artisan migrate;
php artisan data:import;
```

If you would like to seed the environment with test data, you can run:

```
php artisan db:seed;
```

## Front-end

To build the ReactJS application bundle (which is served by Laravel), run:

```
yarn prod;
```

# Local environment (sail)

Sail is a docker-based development environment for laravel. This repository contains a `docker-composer.yml` file which defines the docker configuration.

To start the sail container, install Docker and then run:

```

```
